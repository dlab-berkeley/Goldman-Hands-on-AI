The materials for this workshop are located [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GHvBg7aNsoV57uvKs1H09gy8CqnX5-pLK9R1TLOoHLU).

## Prerequisites

This workshop assumes familiarity with the concepts covered in [D-Lab Demystifying AI Workshop](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Goldman-Demystifying-AI). While prior attendance is not strictly required, participants should have a basic understanding of how Large Language Models work and their core limitations.

## Workshop Goals

In this hands-on workshop for GSPP students, we focus on practical application of AI tools for policy-relevant tasks. You'll learn **prompt engineering frameworks** to get better results from AI, practice using AI for common policy work products like **issue scans**, **policy memos**, and **evidence synthesis**, and develop strategies for **responsible, transparent use** in professional settings. Throughout, we emphasize staying "above the AI baseline"—using AI to enhance your work while demonstrating the critical judgment and contextual expertise that only human analysts can provide.

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Apply **prompt engineering frameworks** (such as CLEAR) to improve AI outputs for policy tasks.
- Use AI tools effectively for **evidence assembly**, **stakeholder analysis**, and **memo drafting**.
- **Critically evaluate** AI-generated content for accuracy, bias, and missing context.
- Develop workflows for using AI in **internships**, **capstone projects**, and professional policy work.
- Articulate where **human judgment remains essential** in policy analysis.

This workshop does not cover the following:

- Foundational concepts underlying AI, machine learning, and neural networks. This is covered in [Goldman Demystifying AI](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Goldman-Demystifying-AI).
- Applied coding for Machine Learning. This is covered in [Python Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals) and [R Machine Learning with tidymodels](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Machine-Learning).
- Using LLMs for academic research applications. This is covered in [LLMs for Exploratory Research](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/LLMs-Exploratory-Research).

## Workshop Structure

This 2-hour workshop is highly interactive. You'll need access to at least one AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) on your laptop. The session includes:

1. **Prompt Engineering Framework** – Learn the CLEAR method for structuring effective prompts
2. **Issue Scan Exercise** – Practice rapid evidence assembly on an assigned policy topic
3. **Memo Drafting Practice** – Use AI to draft policy memo components, then refine
4. **Human Overlay Exercise** – Identify what AI misses and where your expertise adds value
5. **Professional Workflows** – Strategies for transparent AI use in internships and capstones
